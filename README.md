# Anti-Cancer-Drug-Activity-
## The Project
**This competition is a bioassay task for anticancer activity prediction, where each chemical compound is represented as a graph, with atoms representing nodes and bonds as edges. A chemical compound is positive against non-small cell lung cancer, or negative otherwise. Up to this point, you have learned various tricks and mechanisms to be used for building neural networks/tuning models.**\
## How we solve it
**This project is alittle different as its dataset is SDF File, but we made analysis on tha data as usual . This data wants only resampling, then we tried many trails to be able to get the best hyperparameter . 
We used Neural Network and our metric was AUC. Here the [Link of the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cisc873-dm-w23-a6)**
