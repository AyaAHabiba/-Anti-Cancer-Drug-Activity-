# Anti-Cancer-Drug-Activity
## Introduction
Welcome to the Anti-Cancer-Drug-Activity Prediction Challenge! In this competition, hosted on Kaggle, participants are tasked with predicting the activity of anti-cancer drugs based on various molecular features. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the effectiveness of different compounds in inhibiting cancer cell growth.

## Dataset
The dataset provided for this competition includes the following files(as it is written in sdf formate):

* train.csv: This file contains the training data, which includes molecular features of anti-cancer drugs along with their corresponding activity labels.
* test.csv: This file contains the test data, which includes molecular features for which predictions need to be made.
* Additional files: Depending on the competition setup, there may be additional files providing supplementary information about the compounds or experimental procedures.
  
## Data Exploration
Understanding the characteristics of the dataset is crucial for developing effective predictive models. Some key aspects of data exploration include:

Analyzing the distribution of the target variable (drug activity).
Exploring relationships between molecular features and drug activity.
Identifying any missing values or outliers and determining appropriate strategies for handling them.
Visualizing the data to uncover patterns and correlations.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a vital role in extracting relevant information from the raw data. Some feature engineering techniques that may be applicable include:

Transforming molecular features using domain-specific knowledge or techniques such as molecular fingerprints.
Handling categorical variables or text data through encoding techniques or natural language processing (NLP) methods.
Model Selection(train_test_split)
For this predictive modeling task, participants may experiment with various machine learning algorithms and modeling techniques, including but not limited to:

Neural Network with different layers in each trail
* GNN
* GGNN
* RGAT
* GNN-FiLM
* RGCN
Participants are encouraged to evaluate the performance of multiple models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as auc.

## Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the developed models, participants typically employ techniques such as cross-validation on the training data and assessing model performance on a held-out validation set. Additionally, the final model's performance is evaluated on the competition leaderboard using the provided test set.

## Results
After training and fine-tuning the models, participants can submit their predictions for evaluation on the competition platform. The results are typically scored based on predefined evaluation metrics, and participants can track their performance on the leaderboard throughout the competition duration.

## Conclusion
Participating in the Anti-Cancer-Drug-Activity Prediction Challenge offers an opportunity to contribute to the advancement of cancer research and drug discovery. By leveraging machine learning techniques and domain knowledge, participants can develop models that have the potential to identify promising compounds for further experimental validation and clinical trials.
